## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run
Clone the repository or download the individual Java files.

For each file, compile and run using the following commands:

javac <filename>.java
java <filename>

For example, to run the AES Modes program:

javac AESModes.java
java AESModes

Follow the instructions printed in the console for user inputs.

## üß∞ Requirements
Java JDK 8 or higher

No external libraries required (uses Java's built-in javax.crypto package for DES/AES, and custom algorithms for Affine, Hill, and Playfair ciphers)

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
DES ECB Mode is not recommended for secure cryptographic applications because it reveals patterns in the plaintext. Use CBC or GCM modes for better security.

Brute-force Attack: The DES brute-force example uses a very simplified 8-bit key space for educational purposes. Real-world attacks would require much more computational power.

IV Management: In CBC mode, an IV (Initialization Vector) is required, which is hardcoded in the example. Use secure, random IVs in production code.

Affine Cipher: The Affine Cipher works with two keys, and only certain values are valid for the key pair (a, b) to ensure invertibility.

Hill Cipher: The Hill Cipher requires a key matrix to be invertible. It is a polygraphic substitution cipher and works on blocks of text.

Playfair Cipher: The Playfair Cipher works on digraphs (pairs of letters). A key matrix of 5x5 letters is used for encryption/decryption.

AES Modes: AES is demonstrated in several modes of operation, including ECB, CBC, CTR, and GCM. GCM mode also provides authentication, adding integrity checks.
